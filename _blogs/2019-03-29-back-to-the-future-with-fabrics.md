## A New Post

Precision in language is important to me, so a word like "fabric" can be vexing.  The word "fabrics", like "SDN" and "Cloud", has the potential to mean something very specfic and something entirely nebulous.  It's a slippery word.  Fabrics have existed for a long time.  In a NPU, a fabric module in a chassis, a fabric chassis in a multi-chassis system or the mesh created by spines and leafs in a data center fabric.  Typically refers to a statistically non-blocking architecture as first described by Charles Clos.  Others have stretched (sorry) the fabric concept.  The idea has also been extended to be any system with a unified underlay (e.g. segment routing) and an overlay for services or one that is just "meshier" than normal, with more links and devices, that leverages scale out principles.  Everyone can agree that a common underlay is a good idea.

### Scale and Availability
Cattle vs. Pets, Upgradability

### Traffic patterns

### Cost of fabrics
cables, optics

### Automation -- scaling ops

### Fabrics today  -- Conclusion
scale out good, horizontal traffic.  PoP as a Fabric.
