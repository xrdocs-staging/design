# Overview 

Routed Optical Networking as part of Cisco's Converged SDN Transport
architecture brings network simplification to the physical network
infrastructure, just as EVPN and Segment Routing simplify the service and
traffic engineering network layers. Routed Optical Networking collapses complex
technologies and network layers into a single cost efficient and easy to manage
network infrastructure. Here we present the Cisco Routed Optical Networking
architecture and validated design.   

# Key Drivers

## Changing Networks  

Internet traffic has seen a compounded annual growth rate of 30% or higher over
the last ten years, as more devices are connected, end user bandwidth speeds
increase, and applications continue to move to the cloud. The introduction of 5G
in mobile carriers and backhaul providers is also a disruptor, networks must be
built to handle the advanced services and traffic increase associated with 5G.
Networks must evolve so the infrastructure layer can keep up with the service
layer. 400G Ethernet is the next evolution for SP IP network infrastructure, and
we must make that as efficient as possible.  

## Network Complexity  

### Background 

Computer networks at their base are a set of interconnected nodes to delivery
data between two endpoints. In the very beginning, these networks were designed
using a layered approach to separate functions. The OSI model is an example of
how functional separation has led to innovation by allowing different standards
bodies to work in parallel at each layer. In some cases even these OSI layers
are further split into different layers. While these layers can bring some cost
benefit, it also brings added complexity. Each layer has its own management,
control plane, planning, and operational model. 

### Today's Complex Multi-Layer Networks 

#### DWDM 

Most modern SP networks start at the physical fiber optic layer. Above the
physical fiber is technology to allow multiple photonic wavelengths to traverse
a single fiber and be switched at junction points, we will call that the DWDM
layer. 
#### OTN

In some networks, above this DWDM layer is an OTN layer, OTN being the
evolution of traditional SONET/SDH networks. OTN grooms low speed TDM services
into higher speed containers, and if OTN switching is involved, allows switching
these services at intermediate points in the network.  

#### Ethernet/IP 

In all networks, there is
an Ethernet layer on which IP services traverse. Almost all traffic carried
today is IP. Ethernet and IP is used due to its ability to support statistical
multiplexing and topology flexibility. In larger networks today, the Ethernet/IP
layer does not traverse the OTN layer, the OTN layer is typically used only for
business services. 

#### Inefficiences Between Layers  

OTN and IP network traffic must be converted into wavelength
signals to traverse the DWDM network. This has traditionally required dedicated
external hardware, a transponder.  All of these layers bring complexity, and
today some of those layers, such as OTN, bring little to the table in terms of
efficiency or additional value. OTN switching, like ATM previously, has not been
able to keep up with traffic demands due to very complex hardware. Unlike
Ethernet/IP, OTN is also not widely interoperable, locking providers into a
single vendor or solution long-term.

### Complex Operations 

Networks involving opaque layers are difficult to plan, build, and operate.  IP and 
optical networks often have duplicate teams covering similar tasks. Network protection 
and restoration is also often complicated by different schemes running independently across 
layers. The industry has tried over decades to solve some of these issues with complex 
control planes such as GMPLS, but we are now at an evolution point where simplifying the physical 
layers and reducing control plane complexity in the optical layer allows a natural progression to a 
single control-plane and protection/restoration layer.  

### Reducing Complexity

Simple networks are easier to build and easier to operate. As networks scale to
handle traffic growth, the level of network complexity must remain flat.

IPoDWDM has attempted to move the transponder function into the router to remove
the transponder and add efficiency to networks. In lower bandwidth applications,
it's a very valid approach. CWDM, DWDM SFP/SFP+, and CFP2-DCO pluggable
transceivers have been used for many years now to build access, aggregation, and
lower speed core networks. With the evolution to 400G and advanced in technology
the industry saw an opportunity to unlock this potential in higher speed
networks. 

Transponder or muxponders have typically been used to aggregate multiple 10G or
100G signals into a single wavelength. However, with reach limitations, and the
fact transponders are still operating at 400G wavelength speeds, the transponder
becomes a 1:1 input to output stage in the network, adding no benefit. 

The Routed Optical Networking architecture unlocks this efficiency for networks
of all sizes, due to advancements in coherent plugable technology. 

## Network Cost  

Simplyfing networks reduces both capex and opex. As we move to 400G, the network
cost is shifted away from routers and router ports to optics. Any way we can
reduce the number of 400G interconnects on the network will greatly reduce cost.
Modeling networks with 400ZR and OpenZR+ optics in place of traditional
transponders and muxponders shows this in almost any network scenario. It also 
results in a reduced space and power footprint.  

## Operational Complexity 



# Routed Optical Networking Solution Overview 

As part of the Converged SDN Transport architecture, Routed Optical Networking
extends the key tenet of network simplification.  Routed Optical Networking
tackles the challenges of building and managing networks by simplifying both the
infrastructure and operations.  

# Enabling Technologies  
## Pluggable Digital Coherent Optics 

Simple networks are easier to build and easier to operate. As networks scale to
handle traffic growth, the level of network complexity must decline or at least
remain flat. 

IPoDWDM has attempted to move the transponder function into the router to remove
the transponder and add efficiency to networks. In lower bandwidth applications,
it has been a very successful approach. CWDM, DWDM SFP/SFP+, and CFP2-DCO
pluggable transceivers have been used for many years now to build access,
aggregation, and lower speed core networks. The evolution to 400G and
advances in technology created an opportunity to unlock this potential
in higher speed networks.   

Transponder or muxponders have typically been used to aggregate multiple 10G or
100G signals into a single wavelength. However, with reach limitations, and the
fact transponders are still operating at 400G wavelength speeds, the transponder
becomes a 1:1 input to output stage in the network, adding no benefit. 

The Routed Optical Networking architecture unlocks this efficiency for networks
of all sizes, due to advancements in coherent plugable technology. 

## QSFP-DD and 400ZR and OpenZR+ Standards   

As mentioned, the industry saw a point to improve network efficiency by shifting
coherent DWDM functions to router pluggables. Technologiy advancements have
shrunk the DCO components into the standard QSFP-DD form factor, meaning no
specialized hardware and the ability to use the highest capacity routers
available today.  ZR/OpenZR+ DD optics can be used in the same ports as the
highest speed 400G non-DCO transceivers. 

[insert picture of transceiver]

Two industry optical standards have emerged to cover a variety of use cases. The
OIF created the 400ZR specification,
https://www.oiforum.com/technical-work/hot-topics/400zr-2/ as a 400G interopable
standard for metro reach coherent optics. The industry saw the benefit of the
approach, but wanted to cover longer distances and have flexibility in
wavelength rates, so the OpenZR+ MSA was created, https://www.openzrplus.org.
The following table outlines the specs of each standard.  

![](http://xrdocs.io/design/images/ron-hld/zr_zrp_specs.png)

The following part numbers are used for Cisco's ZR400 and OpenZR+ MSA transceivers 

|Standard|Part| 
|--------|----|
400ZR| QDD-400G-ZR-S| 
|OpenZR+| QDD-400G-ZRP-S|

Cisco datasheet for these transceivers can be found at https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/interfaces-modules/transceiver-modules/datasheet-c78-744377.html

## High Density Cisco Routers

We are at a point in NPU development where the pace of NPU bandwidth growth has
outpaced network traffic growth. Single NPUs such as Cisco's Silicon One have a
capacity exceeding 12.8Tbps in a single NPU package without sacrificing
flexibility and rich feature support. This growth of NPU capacity also brings
reduction in cost, meaning forwarding traffic at the IP layer is more
advantageous vs. a network where layer transitions happen often.  

Cisco supports 400ZR and OpenZR+ optics across the NCS 540, NCS 5500, NCS 5700,
ASR 9000, and Cisco 8000 series routers. This enabled providers to utilize the architecture 
across their end to end infrastructure in a variety of router roles. See

## Flexible Cisco DWDM Network Hardware  

Routed Optical Networking shifts an expensive and now often redundant
transponder function into a pluggable transceiver. However, to make the most
efficient use of a valuable resource, the underlying fiber optic network, we
still need a DWDM layer. Routed Optical Networking is flexible enough to work
across point to point, ROADM based optical networks, or a mix of both. Cisco
multiplexers, amplifiers, and ROADMs can satisfy any network need.  See the
validated design hardware section for more infromation.

# Routed Optical Networking Network Use Cases

Cisco is embracing Routed Optical Networking in every SP router role. Access,
aggregation, core, peering, DCI, and even PE routers can be enabled with high
speed DCO optics. Routed Optical Networking is also not limited to SP networks,
there are applications across enterprise, government, and education networks.  

## Where to use 400ZR and where to use OpenZR+

The OIF 400ZR and OpenZR+ MSA standards have important differences. 

400ZR supports 400G rates only, and targets metro distance point to point
connections up to 120km. 400ZR mandates a strict power consumption of 15W as
well. Networks requiring only 400G over distances less than 120km may benefit
from using 400ZR optics. DCI and 3rd party peering interconnection are good use
cases for 400ZR.  

If a provider needs flexibility in rates and distances and wants to standardize
on a single optics type, OpenZR+ can fulfill the need. In areas of the network
where 400G may not be needed, OpenZR+ optics can be run at 100G or 200G.  
Additionally, hardware with QSFP-DD 100G ports can utilize OpenZR+ optics in
100G mode.  This can be ideal for high density access and aggregation networks.

## Supported Optical Topologies 

The future of networks may be a flat L3 network with simple point to point
interconnection, but it will take time to migrate to this type of architecture.
Routed Optical Network supports an evolution to the architecture by working over
most modern photonic DWDM networks.  

## Core Networks

## Routed Optical Networking Validated Routers 

Below is a non-exhaustive snapshot of platforms validated for use with ZR and
OpenZR+ transceivers. Cisco supports Routed Optical Networking in the NCS 540,
NCS 5500/5700, ASR 9000, and Cisco 8000 router families. The breadth of coverage
enabled the solution across all areas of the network.   
### Cisco 8000 Series

optionally protection switch. The NCS 1001 now has specific support for 75Ghz
spaced 400ZR and OpenZR+ wavelengths, with the ability to monitor incoming
wavelengths for power. The 1001 features the ability to determine the proper
amplifier gain setpoints based on the desired user power levels.   

# Routed Optical Networking Automation 
## Overview 
Routed Optical Networking by definition is a disaggregated optical solution,
creating efficiency by moving coherent endpoints in the router. The solution
requires a new way of managing the network, one which unifies the IP and Optical
layers, replacing the traditional siloed tools used in the past. Real
transformation in operations comes from unifying teams and workflows, rather
than trying to make an existing tool fit a role it was not originally designed
for. Cisco's standards-based hierarchical SDN solution allows providers to
manage a multi-vendor Routed Optical Networking solution using standard
interfaces and YANG models.   
## IETF ACTN SDN Model 
The IETF Action and Control of Traffic Engineered Networks group (ACTN) has 
defined a hierarchical controller framework to allow vendors to plug components 
into the framework as needed.  The lowest level controller, the Provisioning Network Controller (PNC), 
is responsible for managing physical devices. These controller expose their resources through 
standard models and interface to a Hierarchical Controller (HCO), called a Multi-Domain Service Controller (MDSC) in the ACTN framework.

## Crosswork Hierarchical Controller (HCO)
Responsible for Multi-Layer Automation is the Crosswork Hierarchical Controller.
CW HCO unifies data from the IP and optical networks into a single network
model. It is also responsible for provisioning multi-layer Routed Optical
Networking links and providing assurance at the IP and optical layers. The
network model allows users to quickly correlate faults and identify at which
layer faults have occurred. Please see the following resources for more
information on Crosswork HCO.

## Crosswork Network Controller 
Crosswork Network Controller (CNC) is a multi-vendor IP domain controller. CNC
collects IP topology and is responsible for IETF L2NM/L3NM service provisioning,
visualization, and assurance. CNC also provides a provisioning interface for
Segment Routing and RSVP-TE Traffic Engineering.    
## Cisco Optical Network Controller 
Cisco Optical Network Controller (Cisco ONC) is responsible for managing Cisco 
optical line systems and circuit services. Cisco ONC exposes a ONF TAPI northbound 
interface, the de facto industry standard for optical netowrk management.
