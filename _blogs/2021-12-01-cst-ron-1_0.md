# Overview 

Routed Optical Networking as part of Cisco's Converged SDN Transport
architecture brings network simplification to the physical network
infrastructure, just as EVPN and Segment Routing simplify the service and
traffic engineering network layers. Routed Optical Networking collapses complex
technologies and network layers into a single cost efficient and easy to manage
network infrastructure. Here we present the Cisco Routed Optical Networking
architecture and validated design.   

# Key Drivers

## Changing Networks  

Internet traffic has seen a compounded annual growth rate of 30% or higher over
the last ten years, as more devices are connected, end user bandwidth speeds
increase, and applications continue to move to the cloud. The introduction of 5G
in mobile carriers and backhaul providers is also a disruptor, networks must be
built to handle the advanced services and traffic increase associated with 5G.
Networks must evolve so the infrastructure layer can keep up with the service
layer. 400G Ethernet is the next evolution for SP IP network infrastructure, and
we must make that as efficient as possible.  

## Network Complexity  

### Background 

Computer networks at their base are a set of interconnected nodes to delivery
data between two endpoints. In the very beginning, these networks were designed
using a layered approach to separate functions. The OSI model is an example of
how functional separation has led to innovation by allowing different standards
bodies to work in parallel at each layer. In some cases even these OSI layers
are further split into different layers. While these layers can bring some cost
benefit, it also brings added complexity. Each layer has its own management,
control plane, planning, and operational model. 

### Today's Complex Multi-Layer Networks 

#### DWDM 

Most modern SP networks start at the physical fiber optic layer. Above the
physical fiber is technology to allow multiple photonic wavelengths to traverse
a single fiber and be switched at junction points, we will call that the DWDM
layer. 
#### OTN

In some networks, above this DWDM layer is an OTN layer, OTN being the
evolution of traditional SONET/SDH networks. OTN grooms low speed TDM services
into higher speed containers, and if OTN switching is involved, allows switching
these services at intermediate points in the network.  

#### Ethernet/IP 

In all networks, there is
an Ethernet layer on which IP services traverse. Almost all traffic carried
today is IP. Ethernet and IP is used due to its ability to support statistical
multiplexing and topology flexibility. In larger networks today, the Ethernet/IP
layer does not traverse the OTN layer, the OTN layer is typically used only for
business services. 

#### Inefficiences Between Layers  

OTN and IP network traffic must be converted into wavelength
signals to traverse the DWDM network. This has traditionally required dedicated
external hardware, a transponder.  All of these layers bring complexity, and
today some of those layers, such as OTN, bring little to the table in terms of
efficiency or additional value. OTN switching, like ATM previously, has not been
able to keep up with traffic demands due to very complex hardware. Unlike
Ethernet/IP, OTN is also not widely interoperable, locking providers into a
single vendor or solution long-term.

### Operational Complexity 

Networks involving opaque layers are difficult to plan, build, and operate.  IP and 
optical networks often have duplicate teams covering similar tasks. Network protection 
and restoration is also often complicated by different schemes running independently across 
layers. The industry has tried over decades to solve some of these issues with complex 
control planes such as GMPLS, but we are now at an evolution point where simplifying the physical 
layers and reducing control plane complexity in the optical layer allows a natural progression to a 
single control-plane and protection/restoration layer.  

## Network Cost  

Simplyfing networks reduces both capex and opex. As we move to 400G, the network
cost is shifted away from routers and router ports to optics. Any way we can
reduce the number of 400G interconnects on the network will greatly reduce cost.
Modeling networks with 400ZR and OpenZR+ optics in place of traditional
transponders and muxponders shows this in almost any network scenario. It also 
results in a reduced space and power footprint.  

# Routed Optical Networking Solution Overview 

As part of the Converged SDN Transport architecture, Routed Optical Networking
extends the key tenet of network simplification.  Routed Optical Networking
tackles the challenges of building and managing networks by simplifying both the
infrastructure and operations.  
# Enabling Technologies  
## Pluggable Digital Coherent Optics 

Simple networks are easier to build and easier to operate. As networks scale to
handle traffic growth, the level of network complexity must decline or at least
remain flat. 

IPoDWDM has attempted to move the transponder function into the router to remove
the transponder and add efficiency to networks. In lower bandwidth applications,
it has been a very successful approach. CWDM, DWDM SFP/SFP+, and CFP2-DCO
pluggable transceivers have been used for many years now to build access,
aggregation, and lower speed core networks. The evolution to 400G and
advances in technology created an opportunity to unlock this potential
in higher speed networks.   

Transponder or muxponders have typically been used to aggregate multiple 10G or
100G signals into a single wavelength. However, with reach limitations, and the
fact transponders are still operating at 400G wavelength speeds, the transponder
becomes a 1:1 input to output stage in the network, adding no benefit. 

The Routed Optical Networking architecture unlocks this efficiency for networks
of all sizes, due to advancements in coherent plugable technology. 

## QSFP-DD and 400ZR and OpenZR+ Standards   

As mentioned, the industry saw a point to improve network efficiency by shifting
coherent DWDM functions to router pluggables. Technologiy advancements have
shrunk the DCO components into the standard QSFP-DD form factor, meaning no
specialized hardware and the ability to use the highest capacity routers
available today.  ZR/OpenZR+ DD optics can be used in the same ports as the
highest speed 400G non-DCO transceivers. 

[insert picture of transceiver]

Two industry optical standards have emerged to cover a variety of use cases. The
OIF created the 400ZR specification,
https://www.oiforum.com/technical-work/hot-topics/400zr-2/ as a 400G interopable
standard for metro reach coherent optics. The industry saw the benefit of the
approach, but wanted to cover longer distances and have flexibility in
wavelength rates, so the OpenZR+ MSA was created, https://www.openzrplus.org.
The following table outlines the specs of each standard. ZR400 and OpenZR+ transceivers 
are tunable across the ITU C-Band, 196.1 To 191.3 THz.  

![](http://xrdocs.io/design/images/ron-hld/zr_zrp_specs.png)

The following part numbers are used for Cisco's ZR400 and OpenZR+ MSA transceivers 

|Standard|Part| 
|--------|----|
400ZR| QDD-400G-ZR-S| 
|OpenZR+| QDD-400G-ZRP-S|

Cisco datasheet for these transceivers can be found at <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/interfaces-modules/transceiver-modules/datasheet-c78-744377.html> 

## Cisco Routers

We are at a point in NPU development where the pace of NPU bandwidth growth has
outpaced network traffic growth. Single NPUs such as Cisco's Silicon One have a
capacity exceeding 12.8Tbps in a single NPU package without sacrificing
flexibility and rich feature support. This growth of NPU capacity also brings
reduction in cost, meaning forwarding traffic at the IP layer is more
advantageous vs. a network where layer transitions happen often.  

Cisco supports 400ZR and OpenZR+ optics across the NCS 540, NCS 5500, NCS 5700,
ASR 9000, and Cisco 8000 series routers. This enabled providers to utilize the architecture 
across their end to end infrastructure in a variety of router roles. See   

![](http://xrdocs.io/design/images/ron-hld/npu_bandwidth.png)


## Cisco DWDM Network Hardware  

Routed Optical Networking shifts an expensive and now often redundant
transponder function into a pluggable transceiver. However, to make the most
efficient use of a valuable resource, the underlying fiber optic network, we
still need a DWDM layer. Routed Optical Networking is flexible enough to work
across point to point, ROADM based optical networks, or a mix of both. Cisco
multiplexers, amplifiers, and ROADMs can satisfy any network need.  See the
validated design hardware section for more infromation.

# Routed Optical Networking Network Use Cases

Cisco is embracing Routed Optical Networking in every SP router role. Access,
aggregation, core, peering, DCI, and even PE routers can be enabled with high
speed DCO optics. Routed Optical Networking is also not limited to SP networks,
there are applications across enterprise, government, and education networks.  

![](http://xrdocs.io/design/images/ron-hld/network-use-cases.png)


## Where to use 400ZR and where to use OpenZR+

The OIF 400ZR and OpenZR+ MSA standards have important differences. 

400ZR supports 400G rates only, and targets metro distance point to point
connections up to 120km. 400ZR mandates a strict power consumption of 15W as
well. Networks requiring only 400G over distances less than 120km may benefit
from using 400ZR optics. DCI and 3rd party peering interconnection are good use
cases for 400ZR.  

If a provider needs flexibility in rates and distances and wants to standardize
on a single optics type, OpenZR+ can fulfill the need. In areas of the network
where 400G may not be needed, OpenZR+ optics can be run at 100G or 200G.
Additionally, hardware with QSFP-DD 100G ports can utilize OpenZR+ optics in
100G mode.  This can be ideal for high density access and aggregation networks.

## Supported Optical Topologies 

The future of networks may be a flat L3 network with simple point to point
interconnection, but it will take time to migrate to this type of architecture.
Routed Optical Network supports an evolution to the architecture by working over
most modern photonic DWDM networks.  Below gives just a few of the supported
optical topologies including both point to point and ROADM networks. 

### 64 Channel FOADM P2P Deployment 
This example provides up to 25.6Tb on a single network span, and highlights the 
simpliicty of the Routed Optical Networking solution.  The "optical" portion of the 
network including the ZR/ZR+ configuration can be completed in a matter of minutes from 
start to finish.   

![](http://xrdocs.io/design/images/ron-hld/optical-zr-p2p.png)

### Colorless Add/Drop Deployment 
Using the NCS2K-MF-6AD-CFS colorless NCS2K-MF-LC module along with the LC16 LC
aggregation module, and SMR20-FS ROADM module, a scalable colorless add/drop
complex can be deployed to support 400ZR and OpenZR+.   

![](http://xrdocs.io/design/images/ron-hld/optical-zrp-colorless.png)

### Multi-Degree ROADM Deployment 
In this example a 3 degree ROADM node is shown with a local add/drop degree. The
Routed Optical Networking solution fully supports ROADM based networks with
optical bypass. The traffic demands of the network will dictate the most
efficient network build. In cases where an existing or new build requires DWDM
switching capability, ZR and ZR+ wavelengths are easily provisioned over the
infrastructure.  

![](http://xrdocs.io/design/images/ron-hld/optical-zrp-roadm.png)

### Long-Haul Deployment 
Cisco has demonstrated in a physical lab 400G OpenZR+ services provisioned
across 1200km. 300G, 200G, and 100G signals can achieve even greater distances.
OpenZR+ is not just for shorter reach applications, it fulfills an ideal sweet
spot in most provider networks in terms of bandwidth and reach.

### ASR 9000 Series 

The ASR 9000 is the most widely deployed SP router in the industry.  It has a
rich heritage dating back almost 20 years, but Cisco continues to innovate on
the ASR 9000 platform. The ASR 9000 series now supports 400G QSFP-DD on a
variety of line cards and the ASR 9903 2.4Tbps 3RU platform.  

See more information on Cisco ASR 9000 at <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/routers/asr-9000-series-aggregation-services-routers/data_sheet_c78-501767.html>

### NCS 540 Series 

The 1Tbps N540-24QL16DD-SYS high density router brings QSFP-DD and Routed Optical Networking
ZR/OpenZR+ optics to a flexible access and aggregation platform. Using OpenZR+ optics it allows a 
migration path from 100G to 400G access rings or uplinks when used in an aggregation role.

optical topologies and deployment use cases. Simple point to point to
multi-degree CDC deployments are all supported as part of Routed Optical
Networking.   
### NCS 1000 Multiplexer

The NCS1K-MD-64-C is a new fixed multiplexer designed specifically
for the 400G 75Ghz 400ZR and OpenZR+ wavelengths, allowing up to 25.6Tbps on a
single fiber. 
### NCS 1001 

The NCS 1001 is utiized in point to point network spans as an amplifier and
optionally protection switch. The NCS 1001 now has specific support for 75Ghz
spaced 400ZR and OpenZR+ wavelengths, with the ability to monitor incoming
wavelengths for power. The 1001 features the ability to determine the proper
amplifier gain setpoints based on the desired user power levels.   

# Routed Optical Networking Automation 
## Overview 
Routed Optical Networking by definition is a disaggregated optical solution,
creating efficiency by moving coherent endpoints in the router. The solution
requires a new way of managing the network, one which unifies the IP and Optical
layers, replacing the traditional siloed tools used in the past. Real
transformation in operations comes from unifying teams and workflows, rather
than trying to make an existing tool fit a role it was not originally designed
for. Cisco's standards-based hierarchical SDN solution allows providers to
manage a multi-vendor Routed Optical Networking solution using standard
interfaces and YANG models.   
## IETF ACTN SDN Model 
The IETF Action and Control of Traffic Engineered Networks group (ACTN) has 
defined a hierarchical controller framework to allow vendors to plug components 
into the framework as needed.  The lowest level controller, the Provisioning Network Controller (PNC), 
is responsible for managing physical devices. These controller expose their resources through 
standard models and interface to a Hierarchical Controller (HCO), called a Multi-Domain Service Controller (MDSC) in the ACTN framework.   

![](http://xrdocs.io/design/images/ron-hld/actn-framework.png){:height="90%" width="90%"}

## Cisco's SDN Controller Automation Stack
Aligning to the ACTN framework, Cisco's automation stack includes a multi-vendor IP domain controller (PNC), optical domain controller (PNC), 
and multi-vendor hierarchical controller (HCO/MDSC).    

![](http://xrdocs.io/design/images/ron-hld/cisco-automation-stack.png)

## Crosswork Hierarchical Controller (HCO)
Responsible for Multi-Layer Automation is the Crosswork Hierarchical Controller. CW HCO is responsible for the following network functions: 

* CW HCO unifies data from the IP and optical networks into a single network
  model. HCO utilizes industry standard IETF topology models for IP and TAPI for
  optical topology and service information. HCO can also leverage legacy EMS/NMS
  systems or device interrogation.   
* Responsible for managing multi-layer Routed Optical Networking links using a
  single UI.    
*  Providing assurance at the IP and optical layers in a single tool. The
   network model allows users to quickly correlate faults and identify at which
   layer faults have occurred.
* Additional HCO applications include the Root Cause Analaysis tool, able to
  quickly correlate upper layer faults to an underlying cause.   

Please see the following resources for more information on Crosswork HCO. <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/cloud-systems-management/crosswork-network-automation/solution-overview-c22-744695.html> 

![](http://xrdocs.io/design/images/ron-hld/hco-multi-layer-circuit.png){:height="100%" width="100%"}

## Crosswork Network Controller 
Crosswork Network Controller (CNC) is a multi-vendor IP domain controller. CNC is responsible 
for the following IP network functions. 

* Collecting Ethernet, IP, RSVP-TE, and SR network information for internal applications and
  exposing northbound via IETF RFC 8345 topology models 
* Collecting traffic information from the network for use with CNC's traffic optimization application, Crosswork Optimization Engine 
* Perform provisioning of SR-TE, RSVP-TE, L2VPN, and L3VPN using standard industry models (IETF TEAS-TE, L2NM, L3NM) via UI or northbound API 
* Visualization and assurance of SR-TE, RSVP-TE, and xVPN services 
* Use additional CW applications to perform telemetry collection/alerting, zero-touch provisioning, and automated and assurance network changes  

More information on Crosswork and CNC can be found at <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/cloud-systems-management/crosswork-network-automation/datasheet-c78-743456.html>

## Cisco Optical Network Controller 
Cisco Optical Network Controller (Cisco ONC) is responsible for managing Cisco 
optical line systems and circuit services. Cisco ONC exposes a ONF TAPI northbound 
interface, the de facto industry standard for optical netowrk management. Cisco ONC 
runs as an application on the same Crosswork Infrastructure as CNC.  

More information on Cisco ONC can be found at <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/optical-networking/optical-network-controller/series.html> 

## Cisco Network Services Orchestrator and Routed Optical Networking ML Core Function Pack 
Cisco NSO is the industry standard for service orchestration and device configuration management. The 
RON-ML CFP can be used to fully configure an IP link between routers utilizing 400ZR/OpenZR+ optics over a 
Cisco optical line system using Cisco ONC. This includes IP addressing and adding links to an existing Ethernet 
LAG. The CFP can also support optical-only provisoining on the router to fit into existing optical provisioning 
workflows.  

# Routed Optical Networking Service Management 
## Supported Frequencies 

The frequency may be set between 191.275Thz and 196.125Thz in increments of
6.25Ghz, supporting flex spectrum applications. To maximize the available C-Band
spectrum, these are the recommended 64 channels, also aligning to the
NCS1K-MD-64-C fixed channel add/drop multiplexer.

## Supported Line Side Rate and Modulation  

OIF 400ZR transceivers support 400G only per the OIF specification. OpenZR+
transceivers can support 100G, 200G, 300G, or 400G line side rate. See router
platform documentation for supported rates. The modulation is determined by 
the line side rate.  400G will utilize 16QAM, 300G 8QAM, and 200G/100G rates will 
utilize QPSK.     

## IOS-XR CLI Configuration
Configuring the router portion of the Routed Optical Networking link is very
simple.  All optical configuration related to the ZR/ZR+ optics configuration is
located under the optics cotroller relevent to the faceplate port. Default
configuration the optics will be in an up/up state using a frequency of
193.10Thz.

The basic configuration with a specific frequency of 195.65 Thz is located below,   
the only required component is the bolded channel frequency setting.  

**ZR/ZR+ Optics Configuration** 

```yaml

### IOS-XR NETCONF Configuration 
All configuration performed in IOS-XR today can also be done using NETCONF/YANG. The following payload exhibits the models 
and configuration used to perform router optics provisioning. This is a more complete example showing the FEC, power, modulation,

## Crosswork HCO UI Provisioning 

End-to-End IP+Optical provisioning can be done using HCO GUI IP Link
provisioning. Those familiar with traditional GUI EMS/NMS systems for service
management will have a very familiar experience. HCO provisioning will provision
both the router optics as well as the underlying optical network to support the
ZR/ZR+ wavelength.   

### Inter-Layer Link Definition 

End to end provisoining requires first defining the Inter-Layer link between the
router ZR/ZR+ optics and the optical line system add/drop ports. This is done
using a GUI based NMC (Network Media Channel) Cross-Link application in CW HCO.
The below screenshot shows defined NMC cross-links.   

![](http://xrdocs.io/design/images/ron-hld/ron-hco-nmc-xconnects.png)
### IP Link Provisioning 
Once the inter-layer links are created, the user can then proceed in
provisioning an end to end circuit.  The provisioning UI takes as input the two
router endpoints, the associated ZR/ZR+ ports, and the IP addressing or bundle
membership of the link. The optical line system provisioning is abstracted from
the user, simplifying the end to end workflow. The frequency and power is
automatically derived by Cisco Optical Network Controller based on the add/drop
port and returned as a paramter to be used in router optics provisioning.  

![](http://xrdocs.io/design/images/ron-hld/ron-hco-ip-link-provisioning.png)

### Operational Discovery 
The HCO provisoining process also performs a discovery phase to ensure the
service is operational before considering the provisioning complete. If
operational discovery fails, the end to end service will be rolled back.  

## NSO RON-ML CFP Provisioning
Providers familiar with using Cisco Network Service Orchestrator have an option
to utilize NSO to perform IP+Optical provisioning of Routed Optical Networking
services. Cisco has created the Routed Optical Network Multi-Layer Core Function
Pack, RON-ML CFP to perform end to end provisioning of services. The
aforementioned CW HCO provisioning utilizes the RON-ML CFP to perform end device
provisioning.  

Please see the Cisco Routed Optical Networking RON-ML CFP documentation located at 

### RON Inter-Layer Links 
Similar to the use case with CW HCO provisioning, before end to end provisioning
can be performed, inter-layer links must be provisioned between the optical
ZR/ZR+ port and the optical line system add/drop port.  This is done using the
"inter-layer-link" NSO service. The optical end point can be defined as either a
TAPI SIP or by the TAPI equipment inventory identifier. Inter-layer links are 
not required for router-only provisioning.   

### RON-ML End to End Service 
The RON-ML service is responsible for end to end IP+optical provisioning. RON-ML
supports full end to end provisioning, router-only provisioning, or optical-only
provisioning where only the router ZR/ZR+ configuration is performed. The
frequency and transmit power can be manually defined or optionally provided by
Cisco ONC when end to end provisioning is performed.   

### RON-ML API Provisioning
Use the following URL for NSO provisioning: <http://<nso host>/restconf/data>

# Routed Optical Networking Assurance 

## Crosswork HCO 
### Multi-Layer Path Trace 
Using topology and service data from both the IP and Optical network CW HCO can
display the full service from IP services layer to the physical fiber.  Below is
an example of the "waterfall" trace view from the OTS (Fiber) layer to the
Segment Routing TE layer across all layers. CW HCO identifies specific Routed
Optical Networking links using ZR/ZR+ optics as seen by the ZRC (ZR Channel) and
ZRM (ZR Media) layers from the 400ZR specification.  

![](http://xrdocs.io/design/images/ron-hld/ron-hco-link-trace.png){:height="100%" width="100%"}

When faults occur at a specific layer, faults will be highlighted in red,
quickly identifying the layer a fault has occurred.  

![](http://xrdocs.io/design/images/ron-hld/ron-hco-link-trace-fault.png){:height="100%" width="100%"}

### Routed Optical Networking Link Assurance 
The Link Assurance application isolates the multi-layer path of a single Routed
Optical Networking service, showing both the router termination points as well
as the optical layer. This information is further enhanced with telemetry data
coming from both the ZR/ZR+ optics as well as the optical link system nodes. 

![](http://xrdocs.io/design/images/ron-hld/ron-hco-link-assurance.png){:height="100%" width="100%"}

Optionally the user can see graphs of collected telemetry data to quickly identify trends or changes in specific operational 
data.
