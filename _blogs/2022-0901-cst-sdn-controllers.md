# Software Defined Networking Overview   

Software Defined Networking or "SDN" is the utilization of external software
elements and APIs to manage physical network infrastructure and the services traversing
the network. The external software elements continuously communicate with the network, consuming 
changes in topology, performance data, and fault information to enact intelligent 
network modifications.   

A set of SDN applications used to mange a defined set of resources are 
combined in what is called a network "controller." 

## SDN Network Variations  

### Non-SDN Network 
A network without SDN uses the traditional distributed control plane protocols 
to create network adjacencies and distribute IP routing information end to end 
across the network. At each node the routing information is used to create 
local forwarding entries. The logic used to program forwarding entries is based 
only on the information carried in the routing protocols. Most networks today 
fall under the umbrella of "non-SDN" networks.

### SDN-Only Network 
The physical separation of the network "control plane" and "data plane" was a
key component of the original SDN definition. Proponents of SDN claimed it would
help simplify the network infrastructure hardware, eschewing the distributed
control plane and using a much simpler API to program hop by hop forwarding
entries. Due to a variety of reasons, this purist view of SDN did not take hold
in packet networks, however we do see instances today of SDN-only optical
transport networks.   

The other main component to any SDN network is the use of open APIs and
programming interfaces, in the original SDN network that was a lower level
API interface directly to the forwarding plane such as OpenFlow.

### Hybrid SDN Network 
Hybrid SDN represents a more pragmatic approach to SDN. Hybrid SDN adds intelligence 
to networks by augmenting the traditional distributed control plane with external 
software applications. 

Open APIs are still critical in a hybrid SDN network, however instead of interfacing 
with the forwarding layer directly, SDN controllers may interface with higher layer 
control plane elements within the network infrastructure.

### Intent Based Networking 
Intent based networking often goes hand in hand with SDN. Intent based
networking uses a declarative configuration model to define the end state of the
network instead of building an explicit list of network instructions. The job of
the SDN controller is to process the abstracted -state configuration and
decompose it into the instructions required to achieve the end state. 

An example of an intent based declarative configuration is "I need a low-latency
EVPN-VPWS between endpoint A and endpoint Z." An IP layer controller may decompose this 
into the the following instructions:  

1. Provision low-latency SR-TE Policies PAZ and PZA between Node A, Node Z, if successful move to step 2.   
2. Dynamically allocate physical interface on Node A, Node Z 
3. Dynamically allocate EVPN EVI on Node A, Node Z 
4. Provision EVPN-VPWS on Node A, Node Z using SR-TE Policy PAZ and PZA.
5. Enable proactive service assurance on EVPN-VPWS service  


# Key Drivers for SDN 

## Dynamic Network Programmability
Agility and flexibility are two tenets of a modern SDN network. SDN software
allows operators to react to network changes such as traffic congestion quickly.
Human intervention adds orders of magnitude of additional time in terms of MTTD
(Mean Time to Detection) and MTTR (Mean Time To Repair).    

## Network Efficiency 
Optimization of network resources is paramount for service providers today.
Efficient networks are provisioned with the minimum amount of capacity to
satisfy the bandwidth and resiliency requirements. Many networks today are 
over provisioned since they do not dynamically re-optimize network infrastructure 
and traffic.   

Reducing the complexity of the network and overall TCO (Total Cost of Ownership)
requires network planning and 

## Network Visibility and Assurance 
Global view, data collection 

Internet traffic has seen a compounded annual growth rate of 30% or higher over
the last ten years, as more devices are connected, end user bandwidth speeds
increase, and applications continue to move to the cloud. The introduction of 5G
in mobile carriers and backhaul providers is also a disruptor, networks must be
built to handle the advanced services and traffic increase associated with 5G.
Networks must evolve so the infrastructure layer can keep up with the service
layer. 400G Ethernet is the next evolution for SP IP network infrastructure, and
we must make that as efficient as possible.  
## Network Complexity  

Computer networks at their base are a set of interconnected nodes to deliver
data between two endpoints. In the very beginning, these networks were designed
using a layered approach to separate functions. The OSI model is an example of
how functional separation has led to innovation by allowing different standards
bodies to work in parallel at each layer. In some cases even these OSI layers
are further split into different layers. While these layers can bring some cost
benefit, it also brings added complexity. Each layer has its own management,
control plane, planning, and operational model. 

# Components Required for SDN Control 
## Model-Driven Configuration 
YANG (Yet Another Network Grammar) has emerged as the de-facto standard language
used to describe network configuration. Device-level models are used to
configure end devices, network models are used to describe higher layer network
infrastructure, and service models are used to standardize how common network
services are defined. Standardized models should be use wherever possible to
enable multi-vendor controller to controller and controller to device
communication.   
## Network Data Collection 
The key to adding intelligence to the physical network is data. The source of the 
data can be from the network itself, from probes external to the network, or from 
completely external data sources containing information that can be used to make 
more intelligent routing decisions. As an example, application layer health can 
be used to effect underlay network routing.  

# Industry Initiatives 
## IETF ACTN SDN Framework 
The IETF Action and Control of Traffic Engineered Networks group (ACTN) has
defined a hierarchical controller framework to allow vendors to plug components
into the framework as needed.  The lowest level controller, the Provisioning
Network Controller (PNC), is responsible for managing physical devices. These
controller expose their resources through standard models and interface to a
Hierarchical Controller (HCO), called a Multi-Domain Service Controller (MDSC)
in the ACTN framework.  

Note that while Cisco is adhering to the IETF framework proposed in 
[RFC8453](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8453/) , Cisco is supporting the most
widely supported industry standards for controller to controller communication
and service definition. In optical the de facto standard is Transport API from
the ONF for the management of optical line system networks and optical services.
In packet we are leveraging Openconfig device models where possible and IETF
models for packet topology (RFC8345) and xVPN services (L2NM and L3NM)

# Cisco's SDN Controller Automation Stack
Aligning to the ACTN framework, Cisco's automation stack includes a
multi-vendor IP domain controller (PNC), optical domain controller (PNC), and
multi-vendor hierarchical controller (HCO/MDSC).    

![]({{site.url}}/design/images/ron-hld/cisco-automation-stack.png)

Cisco believes not all providers consume automation in the same way, so we are
dedicated to make sure we have open interfaces at each layer of the network
stack. At the device level, we utilize standard NETCONF, gRPC, and gNMI
interfaces along with native, standard, and public consortium YANG models. There
is no aspect of a Cisco IOS-XR router today not covered by YANG models. At the
domain level we have Cisco's network controllers, which use the same standard
interfaces to communicate with devices and expose standards based NBIs. Our
multi-layer/multi-domain controller likewise uses the same standard interfaces.

## Crosswork Hierarchical Controller 
Responsible for Multi-Layer Automation is the Crosswork Hierarchical Controller. Crosswork Hierarchical Controller is responsible for the following network functions: 

* CW HCO unifies data from the IP and optical networks into a single network
  model. HCO utilizes industry standard IETF topology models for IP and TAPI for
  optical topology and service information. HCO can also leverage legacy EMS/NMS
  systems or device interrogation.   
* Responsible for managing multi-layer Routed Optical Networking links using a
  single UI.    
*  Providing assurance at the IP and optical layers in a single tool. The
   network model allows users to quickly correlate faults and identify at which
   layer faults have occurred.
* Additional HCO applications include the Root Cause Analysis tool, able to
  quickly correlate upper layer faults to an underlying cause.   

Please see the following resources for more information on Crosswork HCO. <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/cloud-systems-management/crosswork-network-automation/solution-overview-c22-744695.html>

## Crosswork Network Controller 
Crosswork Network Controller is a multi-vendor IP domain controller. Crosswork
Network Controller is responsible for the following IP network functions. 

* Collecting Ethernet, IP, RSVP-TE, and SR network information for internal
  applications and exposing northbound via IETF RFC 8345 topology models 
* Collecting traffic information from the network for use with CNC's traffic
  optimization application, Crosswork Optimization Engine 
* Perform provisioning of SR-TE, RSVP-TE, L2VPN, and L3VPN using standard
  industry models (IETF TEAS-TE, L2NM, L3NM) via UI or northbound API 
* Visualization and assurance of SR-TE, RSVP-TE, and xVPN services 
* Use additional Crosswork applications to perform telemetry collection/alerting,
  zero-touch provisioning, and automated and assurance network changes  

More information on Crosswork and Crosswork Network Controller can be found at <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/cloud-systems-management/crosswork-network-automation/datasheet-c78-743456.html>

## Cisco Optical Network Controller 
Cisco Optical Network Controller (Cisco ONC) is responsible for managing Cisco 
optical line systems and circuit services. Cisco ONC exposes a ONF TAPI northbound 
interface, the de facto industry standard for optical network management. Cisco ONC 
runs as an application on the same Crosswork Infrastructure as CNC.  

More information on Cisco ONC can be found at <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/optical-networking/optical-network-controller/series.html> 

## Cisco Network Services Orchestrator and Routed Optical Networking ML Core Function Pack 
Cisco NSO is the industry standard for service orchestration and device
configuration management. The RON-ML CFP can be used to fully configure an IP
link between routers utilizing 400ZR/OpenZR+ optics over a Cisco optical line
system using Cisco ONC. This includes IP addressing and adding links to an
existing Ethernet LAG. The CFP can also support optical-only provisioning on the
router to fit into existing optical provisioning workflows.

### Multi-Layer Path Trace 
Using topology and service data from both the IP and Optical network CW HCO can
display the full service from IP services layer to the physical fiber.  Below is
an example of the "waterfall" trace view from the OTS (Fiber) layer to the
Segment Routing TE layer across all layers. CW HCO identifies specific Routed
Optical Networking links using ZR/ZR+ optics as seen by the ZRC (ZR Channel) and
ZRM (ZR Media) layers from the 400ZR specification.

When faults occur at a specific layer, faults will be highlighted in red,
quickly identifying the layer a fault has occurred.

### Routed Optical Networking Link Assurance 
The Link Assurance application isolates the multi-layer path of a single Routed
Optical Networking service, showing both the router termination points as well
as the optical layer. This information is further enhanced with telemetry data
coming from both the ZR/ZR+ optics as well as the optical link system nodes.

Optionally the user can see graphs of collected telemetry data to quickly identify trends or changes in specific operational 
data.

## Open-source ZR/ZR+ Monitoring 
Cisco model-driven telemetry along with the open source collector Telegraf and the open source dashboard software 
Grafana can be used to quickly build powerful dashboards to monitor ZR/ZR+ performance.
