# Service Provider network challenges 

Service providers continue to face challenges building networks to satisfy the
evolving demands of network services. The traditional "service edge" of the
network was built using typically larger modular chassis in a centralized
location, resulting in inefficient traffic distribution 

# Cisco Agile Services Networking 

Networks must be built to handle the advanced services and increased traffic
associated with modern network services. Artificial Intelligence is poised to
drive growth in networks as AI applications become more bandwidth intensive.
Networks must evolve so the infrastructure layer can keep up with the services
layer and demands for high bandwidth any to any connectivity. The result of
these shifts is driving traffic away from centralized delivery to a more
distributed network. New network architectures must be considered as design
options moving forward that include these key aspects: Distributed and fixed
routing systems to deliver services at any place in the network Fabric models
delivering scale-out networks that can be built on-demand Flexible deployment
options matching provider requirements Network simplification at all layers of
the network

Cisco's Agile Services Networking introduces an end-to-end architecture which
evolves traditional network design towards a simplified, efficient network
capable of delivering all network services (AI, Residential, Business, 4G/5G
mobile transport, video, IoT) while adding enhanced ability to assure SLAs and
provide security across all layers of the network. These capabilities will be
delivered at all parts of the network without compromise.   

## Agile Services Networking - Agile Metro overview 

The Agile Metro is one component of the overall solution architecture providing 
a scalable any to any network fabric for Metro networks.   

### Agile Services Networking - Agile Metro 

The Agile Metro is a key component of the overall solution as it helps providers build 

![](http://xrdocs.io/design/images/asn-metro/end-to-end.png)

The ASN Metro design brings tremendous value to Service
Providers:

  - **Fast service deployment** and **rapid time to market** through
    fully automated service provisioning and end-to-end network
    programmability

  - **Operational simplicity** with less protocols to operate and manage

  - **Enhanced and optimized operations** using telemetry/analytics in
    conjunction with advanced model-driven automation tools   

**The Agile Metro design is targeted at network operators who:**

  - Want to deploy a simpler and easier to operate network that does not sacrifice functionality 

  - Need a simple, scalable design that can support future growth

  - Want a future proof architecture built using industry-leading technology


## Agile Metro high-level building blocks 

### Cisco routers covering all operator use cases  
### Advanced Network Operating Systems (NOS) 
### Network Automation 
### Architectural principles providing the basic building block for building agile, efficient, and scalable networks 

## Key Agile Metro features  

- **Efficient transport using Routed Optical Networking** Cisco's Routed Optical Network solution simplifies router interconnections across optical fiber, replacing inefficient external transponders with pluggable digital coherent transceivers. Private Line Emulation allows providers to use standard routers to transparently carry Ethernet, OTN/SONET, and Fiber Channel services across an IP network without sacrificing transport layer functionality and resilience.    

- **Simplified network control plane** Based on Segment Routing SRv6 or SR-MPLS, the network control plane is simplified scalable to meet even the largest service provider networks.  

- **Built-in network assurance** Utilizing advanced functions like Segment Routing Performance Measurement (SR-PM), and Integrated Performance Measurement (IPM), the network itself provides advanced assurance and telemetry functionality. When coupled with Cisco Provider Connectivity Assurance sensors, reporting, and advanced correlation it provides end to end assurance from underlay network to overlay services.  

- **Network device convergence** Cisco Routed PON enables providers to provide XGS-PON OLT functionality using a pluggable transceiver. This allows the termination of residential and business PON endpoints on the same routers providing fiber based service termination. 

- **Network infrastructure convergence**  Carrying multiple services across a single unified network is easier to operate than distinct parallel networks. Agile Metro allows operators to converge residential, business, DCI, and future service types onto a single converged metro network with any to any connectivity.   

- **CUPS based distributed subscriber termination** Cisco Cloud Native Broadband Network Gateway (cnBNG) is a CUPS-based solution combining a high-availability cloud native control plane with user-plane elements distributed closer to end users. Distributing the user-plane closer to end users allows for efficient traffic offload vs. traditional BNG deployments where traffic is backhauled to a centralized BNG.    

- **Enhanced security and DDoS protection** Security begins with trust and verification of trust. Cisco's leading NOS security features ensure device authenticity and integrity. Cisco Trust Insights allows providers to monitor and report on the overall trust posture of network devices at all times, alerting on anomalies. Cisco's Edge Protect DDoS solution distributes DDoS detection and mitigation to every device in the network. The distribution of these function is more efficient and scales higher than traditional centralized DDoS detection and mitigation deployments.   

- **Advanced network automation** Simplifying operations requires not only infrastructure simplification but also changes in how networks are operated. The Cisco Crosswork family of network automation software covers the end to end lifecycle of the network. See the section on Network Automation for more detail on how the Agile Metro incorporates these components to help simplify the planning and operation of the network.  

- **Integration across layers** Integration across layers includes both underlay/overlay integrations to enable carrying differentiated service traffic across specific engineered paths as well as the ability to correlate higher layer service to underlay infrastructure down to the physical fiber.  SD-WAN is one use case covered by Agile Metro where SD-WAN overlay services can be monitored along with the underlay paths carrying the traffic. 


# Infrastructure network technical overview

The infrastructure portion of the network refers to the building blocks of any high scale service provider network. The hardware, interconnection, and low level control plane protocols are utilized together to build a modern agile scalable 
network.

# Agile Metro Baseline transport 

## Agile service placement 

In an Agile Metro network services can be located at any point within the network, blurring the traditional 
network boundaries of access, aggregation, edge, and core. These segments in the network may still exist based 
on geographical boundaries and interconnection, but the "edge" terminating user services can be placed throughout the metro network. The distribution of services enhances overall network scale and resilience.  

![](http://xrdocs.io/design/images/asn-metro/agile-metro-end-state.png) 


## Network domains and IGP structure 

Network domains are defined by different criteria. Scale is the primary driver
for creating separate network domains but it could be for other reasons such as
administrative boundaries or geographic regions. In the case of the Agile
network design we will utilize distinct IGP instances at network domain
boundary routers (ABRs). Boundary nodes will contain two or more IGP instances. Traffic paths
crossing domain boundaries can utilize redistribution, SR-TE using SR-PCE, and
traditional overlay options like BGP-LU. SRv6 using aggregation and
redistribution is the preferred approach for greenfield networks and networks
migrating from legacy MPLS (LDP, RSVP-TE) to Segment Routing.   

The Agile Metro achieves network scale by IGP domain separation. 

## Topology options and PE placement - Inline and non-inline PE
The design is flexible to support edge service placement at different places in the network.  

![](http://xrdocs.io/design/images/asn-metro/metro-deployment-options.png) 

### Edge services on a stick 
This model can be utilized for scenarios where the Edge service termination is relatively 
low bandwidth compared to transit traffic and requires utilizing a more sophisticated edge device. In the Agile Metro 
design this includes cases where Carrier Grade NAT is being used or exception handling for MAP-T traffic.   

### Fully distributed edge
This model full distributes edge functions so any router within the metro can provide edge user services. A provider may use a fully distributed edge is if the bandwidth, port, or service scale does not exceed that of a single node or pair of nodes. 

### Edge Fabric 
This design creates a scale out fabric which can be placed within a single provider location or 
utilize WAN connections to create a larger fabric spanning multiple locations. An Edge Fabric is used 
when providers want the ultimate scale in terminating user services, have a necessity for using specific leaf
devices for different services types, or need to create a multi-vendor fabric. See the "Edge Fabric" section of 
the document for more information on building and managing Edge Fabrics.   


## Cisco Routed Optical Networking 
Routed Optical Networking is a foundational component of the Agile Metro for network operators with their own fiber assets 
utilizing point to point dark fiber connections or multiplexed DWDM connections. At its basis Routed Optical Networking 
eliminates redundant hardware and simplifies management through advanced automation. Routed Optical Networking works 
with all types of optical networks; P2P dark fiber, simplified P2P DWDM using Cisco's Pluggable OLS with 
passive multiplexers, and traditional multi-degree ROADMs.


![](http://xrdocs.io/design/images/asn-metro/metro-routed-optical-networking.png) 

For more information on Cisco's Routed Optical Networking design please see the 
following high-level design document:  

<https://xrdocs.io/design/blogs/latest-routed-optical-networking-hld> 

## Agile Metro Edge Fabric
Agile Services Networking enables providers to build networks in the way that
best fits their business and service needs. One deployment method is build an
Edge Fabric allowing providers to build a flexible scale-out network providing
Edge services. Each leaf node in the fabric can be dedicated to a specific
service type or multiple services can be deployed to the same fabric. One key
property of the fabric is managing nodes by role and not as individual PE
routers. A role is defined by a set of common properties and service termination
needs. A fabric may be contained within a single location or span multiple
geographic locations, interconnected using Cisco's Routed Optical Networking
solution for simplicity and efficiency.    

![](http://xrdocs.io/design/images/asn-metro/metro-edge-fabric-diagram-1.png){:height="100%" width="100%"}

### Additional Edge Fabric properties  

- Topology-driven group of standard routers 
- Uses standard protocols for intra-fabric control-plane and data plane, 
not proprietary interconnect hardware or proprietary data plane encapsulation 
- Service / UNI facing ports are managed on individual leaf devices  
- No requirement for homogenous hardware, different devices or even vendors could be used as edge leafs  
- Not explicitly a Clos fabric, the spines can be collapsed spine/border nodes, or even terminate some user services  

### Edge Fabric deployment options 
There is also flexibility in how and where the Edge Fabric is deployed in the provider network.  
The diagram shows four potential options, but the deployment is primarily based on the provider requirements. The fully 
distributed edge offers the highest scale and performance, but as interim steps during migration other models may be used.  

![](http://xrdocs.io/design/images/asn-metro/metro-edge-fabric-deployment-options.png){:height="100%" width="100%"}

### Recommended Edge Fabric hardware 
There is no hard and fast rule about specific hardware deployed in a specific
role. Spines should be higher bandwidth and higher port count devices with no
service termination on those nodes. If fixed devices are used as spines, the
Silicon One P100-based 8212-48FH-M and 8711-32FH-M are ideal spines due to their
high 400G and 100G density. P100 routers and line cards also have Edge service
capabilities if there is a requirement for placing some services on the spine
devices. Edge Leaf devices should be chosen based on UNI port speeds, UNI port
bandwidth, and in some cases specific feature support. The NCS 540, NCS
5500/5700, and 8000 series can be utilized for Internet services (DIA), peering,
L2VPN, and L3VPN services. In the case of cnBNG user plane the ASR 9000 series
satisfies that role.  

### Edge Fabric control plane 
The control plane for the Edge Fabric utilizes standard routing protocols. IS-IS
is the recommended IGP protocol to run across the fabric. A large fabric may
utilize a separate IGP instance or IS-IS level for nodes with contiguous
connectivity. It is expected the leaf nodes in a fabric belong to a single
fabric. MP-BGP is utilized as an overlay service protocol, advertising EVPN and
L3VPN routes to build both point-to-point and multi-point services. Internet
services may be contained within a VRF (Internet in a VRF) or in the global
routing table. The design supports using more centralized service route
reflectors or using the edge fabric aggregation nodes as fabric route reflectors
depending on the scale and redundancy required.   

## Segment Routing 

Segment Routing is a foundational component of Agile Services Networking. The
Segment Routing architecture is available with two forwarding planes, IPv6 and
MPLS. SRv6 presents a highly scalable and simplified data plane for modern
networks. SRv6 is simply IP routing, using IPv6 addresses to represent end nodes
as well as end services. The Agile Services Networking solution uses SRv6 with
uSID as the primary dataplane, but also utilizes SR-MPLS which is fully
supported across all hardware, software, and automation products. 

### SRv6 Benefits 

#### Scale 
One of the main benefits of SRv6 is the ability to build networks at huge scale
through address summarization. MPLS networks require a unique label per node be
distributed to all nodes requiring mutual reachability. In most cases there is
also the requirement of distributing a /32 IP prefix as well. In the MPLS CST
design we have the option to eliminate the IP and MPLS label distribution by
utilizing a PCE to compute end to end paths. While this method works well and is
also available for SRv6 it can lead to a large number of SR-TE or SRv6-TE
policies.  

SRv6 allows us to summarize domain loopback addresses at IGP or BGP boundaries.
This means a domain of 1000 nodes no longer requires advertising 1000 IP
prefixes and associated labels, but can be summarized into a single IP
advertisement reachable via a simple longest prefix match (LPM) lookup. Networks
of tens of thousands of nodes can now provide full reachability with very few
IPv6 routes. 

![](http://xrdocs.io/design/images/cst-srv6/cst-srv6-igp-layout.png)

![](http://xrdocs.io/design/images/cst-srv6/cst-srv6-isis-redist.png)

#### Simplified Forwarding 
In SRv6, if a node is not a terminating node it simply forwards the traffic
using IPv6 IP forwarding.  This means nodes which are not SRv6 aware can also
participate in a SRv6 network.  

Forwarding in SRv6 follows the semantics of simple IPv6 routing. The destination 
is always identified as an IPv6 address. In the case of an SRv6 packet without an 
additional SRH, traffic is routed to the endpoint destination node hop by hop 
based on normal destination based prefix lookups. In the case of a SRH, the SRH 
is only processed by a node if it is the destination address in the outer IPv6 
header. If the node is the last SID in the SID list it will pop the SRH and process
the packet further.  If the node is not the last SID in the SID list it will replace
the outer IPv6 destination address with the next IPv6 address in the SID list. 

#### Forwarding and service congruency 
As you will see in the services section, the destination IPv6 address in SRv6 is
the service endpoint. Coupled with the simple forwarding this aids in
troubleshooting and is much easier to understand than the MPLS layered service
and data plane.   


# Control Plane design 

## Control plane elements 

### IS-IS as IGP 
Simplicity is key when deploying modern networks. Legacy networks include a base 
IGP protocol for route distribution along with an overlay protocol used for MPLS 
label distribution. The Agile Services Networking design utilizes a single IGP 
protocol, IS-IS, covering IPv4 and IPv6.   

### IS-IS deployment and network segmentation 

Segmentation of networks may be done at the IGP instance/process level for scale 
or administrative reasons. The ability to aggregate and redistribute SRv6 (It's just IPv6!) prefixes 
across IS-IS area or instance boundaries allows networks to scale to millions of routers
with relatively few prefixes across the network. SRv6 retains Flex-Algo information across
IS-IS instance boundaries.   


![](http://xrdocs.io/design/images/asn-metro/metro-srv6-igp-domains.png){:height="100%" width="100%"}

In the case of SR-MPLS inter-area traffic engineering is solved using SR-PCE, Cisco's 
scalable Path Computation Element.  


### Segment Routing 

As mentioned in the building block section above, Segment Routing is a
foundational element for building a modern services network. It simplifies the
control and data plane of the network, eliminating legacy protocols such as LDP
and RSVP-TE while providing additional capabilities for traffic engineering,
network assurance, and network resiliency. 

SR-MPLS or SRv6 Segment Identifiers (SIDs) are distributed using IS-IS in both 
intra-domain and inter-domain use cases.  

### Segment Routing Flexible Algorithms (Flex-Algo) 

A powerful tool used to create traffic engineered Segment Routing paths is SR
Flexible Algorithms, better known as SR Flex-Algo.  Flex-Algo assigns a specific
set of "algorithms" to a Segment. The algorithm identifies a specific
computation constraint the segment supports. There are standards based algorithm
definitions such as least cost IGP path and latency, or providers can define
their own algorithms to satisfy their business needs.  Agile Services Networking supports
computation of Flex-Algo paths in intra-domain and inter-domain deployments. 
Flex-Algo limits the computation of a path to only those nodes participating in
that algorithm. This gives a powerful way to create multiple network domains
within a single larger network, constraining an SR path computation to segments
satisfying the metrics defined by the algorithm. As you will see, we can now use
a single node SID to reach a node via a path satisfying an advanced constraint
such as delay.  

Operators can solve most traffic engineering use cases with Flex-Algo. Capabilities of Flex-Algo are continually being enhanced, supporting additional metrics and constraints for path computation. In XR 24.4.1 the following metrics and constraints are supported.  

#### Flex-Algo Metrics  

Delay 
: Delay utilizes the measured or statically configured delay of each link to compute an end to end lowest latency path. Delay values are computed or defined using SR Performance Measurement.   
Generic 
: The generic metric type is used by operators to build a custom topology based on their own metrics. The generic metric for each link is defined in the IS-IS configuration for each link. The Flex-Algo topology will only include nodes/links with the generic metric defined, and will follow the lowest cost path using those user-defined metrics. 
TE: 
The TE metric is an additional metric which can be assigned to each link. The TE metric is advertised in the standard IS-IS traffic engineering TLVs.  

#### Flex-Algo Constraints 

Affinity: 
Affinity uses standard unidirectional traffic engineering affinities (groups) to include or exclude links from the topology. IOS-XR also supports reverse affinities, meaning if the affinity is being sent from node B to A, A will take that link into account when computing the Flex-Algo. One use case is if an affinity is being applied by the remote node on the link due to packet errors.  

Minimum Bandwidth: 
The minimum bandwidth metric is uses to prune links below a certain bandwidth value. This is useful for networks with a mix of high and low speed links to ensure traffic does not take a low speed path. An example is a network with 10G access rings connected to a higher speed aggregation network. High speed traffic between aggregation locations should never traverse the access rings, and this is easily achievable using the minimum bandwidth constraint. 

Maximum Delay: 
Maximum delay uses the measured or statically set SR-PM delay values to prune high delay links from the network. While the delay metric will calculate the lowest delay path, this will ensure that path never takes high delay links.  

#### Path Computation across SR Flex-Algo Network 
Flex-Algo works by creating a separate topology for each algorithm. By default,
all links interconnecting nodes participating in the same algorithm can be used
for those paths. If the algorithm is defined to include or exclude specific link
affinities, the topology will reflect it. A SR-TE path computation using a
specific Flex-Algo will use the Algo's topology for end the end path
computation. It will also look at the metric type defined for the Algo and use
it for the path computation. Even with a complex topology, a single SID is used
for the end to end path, as opposed to using a series of node and adjacency SIDs
to steer traffic across a shared topology. Each node participating in the
algorithm has adjacencies to other nodes utilizing the same algorithm, so when an 
incoming SRv6 locator or MPLS label matching the algo SID enters, it will utilize the path
specific to the algorithm. On-demand SR-TE policies can also use a specific algorithm.   


### Traffic Engineering (Tactical Steering) – SR-TE Policy

Segment Routing provides a simple and scalable way of defining an end-to-end
application-aware traffic engineering path known as an SR-TE Policy. The SR-TE
Policy expresses the intent of the applications constraints across the network.
The path computation will minimize the number of segments required to build the
end to end path across the network, simplifying deploying and increasing the
supported path length.   

In the Agile Metro design, SR-TE can be utilized for both IPv6 and MPLS dataplanes for 
more advanced traffic engineering use cases.  

Path computation of the end to end SR-TE path is carried out either on the head-end node 
or by using a PCE (Path Computation Element). SR-TE policies can be persistently configured 
on the head-end node or computed on-demand using Cisco "On-Demand Next Hop" or ODN feature.   


### Circuit Style Segment Routing (SR-MPLS) 

Circuit Style Segment Routing (CS-SR) is another Cisco advancement bringing 
TDM circuit like behavior to SR-TE Policies. These policies use deterministic 
hop by hop routing, co-routed bi-directional paths, hot standby protect paths
with end to end liveness detection, and bandwidth guaranteed services.
Standard Ethernet services not requiring bit transparency can be transported
over a Segment Routing network similar to OTN networks without the additional
cost, complexity, and inefficiency of an OTN network layer.   

### Circuit-Style SR-TE with Bandwidth Admission Control using CNC Circuit Style Manager 

Crosswork Network Controller Circuit Style Manager provides Bandwidth
Admission Controller and guaranteed bandwidth paths for Circuit-Style Policies.
CNC also supports full provisioning, monitoring, and visualization of
Circuit-Style SR-TE Policies.

### Segment Routing Path Computation Element (SR-PCE)

Segment Routing Path Computation Element, or SR-PCE, is a Cisco Path Computation
Engine (PCE) and is implemented as a feature included as part of Cisco IOS-XR
operating system. The function is typically deployed on Cisco's virtual router, the XRv-9000 
as it involves control plane operations only. The SR-PCE
gains network topology awareness from BGP-LS advertisements received from the
underlying IGP network. Such knowledge is leveraged by the embedded multi-domain
computation engine to provide optimal path information to Path Computation
Element Clients (PCCs) using the Path Computation Element Protocol (PCEP).  

The PCC is the device where the service originates (PE) and therefore it
requires end-to-end connectivity over the segment routing enabled
multi-domain network.

### SR-MPLS, SRv6, and Unified MPLS (BGP-LU) Co-existence 

In the Agile Metro design validation is performed for the co-existence of
services using BGP Labeled Unicast transport for inter-domain forwarding and
those using SR-MPLS and SRv6. Many networks deployed today have an existing BGP-LU design
which may not be easily migrated to SR, so graceful introduction between the two
transport methods is required.

## Network timing 
Modern infrastructure services require stable timing. Distributing timing
through the network decreases overall cost by not requiring timing equipment at
end locations. Components used in the Agile Metro design all support Precision
Timing Protocol (PTP) timing distribution and in most cases support Class C
timing accuracy. It is recommended to use G.8257.1 when possible to maintain the
highest level of accuracy across the network. IOS-XR fully supports G.8275.1 to
G.8275.2 interworking, allowing the use of different profiles across the
network. Synchronous Ethernet (SyncE) is also recommended across the network to
maintain stability when timing to the PRC.  

## Quality of Service (Update for 8000)  

## Overview 
Quality of Service is of utmost importance in today's multi-service converged
networks. The Agile Metro design has the ability to enforce end to end traffic
path SLAs using Segment Routing Traffic Engineering. In addition to satisfying
those path constraints, traditional QoS is used to make sure the PHB (Per-Hop
Behavior) of each packet is enforced at each node across the converged network.  

## NCS 540, 560, 5500, and 5700 QoS 
Full details of the NCS 540 and 5500 QoS capabilities and configuration can be found at: 
<https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/iosxr/ncs5500/qos/24xx/configuration/guide/b-qos-cg-ncs5500-24xx.html>

The NCS platforms utilize the same MQC configuration for QoS as other IOS-XR platforms but based on their hardware architecture use different elements for implementing end to end QoS. On these platforms ingress traffic is: 
1. Matched using flexible criteria via Class Maps
2. Assigned to a specific <b>Traffic Class (TC)</b> and/or <b>QoS Group</b> for further treatment on egress 
3. Has its header marked with a specific IPP, DSCP, or MPLS EXP value

<B>Traffic Classes</b> are used internally for determining fabric priority and as the match condition for egress queuing.  <B>QoS Groups</b> are used internally as the match criteria for egress CoS header re-marking. IPP/DSCP marking and re-marking of ingress MPLS traffic is done using _ingress_ QoS policies.  MPLS EXP for imposed labels can be done on ingress or egress, but if you wish to rewrite both the IPP/DSCP and set an explicit EXP for imposed labels, the MPLS EXP must be set on egress.  

The <code>priority-level</code> command used in an egress QoS policy specifies the egress transmit priority of the traffic vs. other priority traffic. Priority levels can be configured as 1-7 with 1 being the highest priority.  Priority level 0 is reserved for best-effort traffic.  

Please note, multicast traffic does not follow the same constructs as unicast traffic for prioritization. All multicast traffic assigned to Traffic Classes 1-4 are treated as Low Priority and traffic assigned to 5-6 treated as high priority.     

## Cisco 8000, 8010, 8600, and 8700 QoS  
The semantics of the QoS configuration of the Cisco 8000 follows similar
configuration guidelines as the NCS 540, 5500, and NCS 5700 series devices. It
utilizes the same traffic class structure, QoS groups, and priority level
behavior to mark traffic and apply queuing behavior. Detailed documentation of
8000 series QoS including platform dependencies can be found at:  

<https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/iosxr/cisco8000/qos/25xx/configuration/b-qos-cg-8k-25xx.html>

## Hierarchical Edge QoS 
Hierarchical QoS enables a provider to set an overall traffic rate across all services, and then configure parameters per-service via a child QoS policy where the percentages of guaranteed bandwidth are derived from the parent rate

### Cisco 8000 H-QoS Platform Support  
Hierarchical QoS will be available on the Cisco 8404, 8010, and 8700 series routers in a future Agile Metro release.  

### NCS 5500/5700 H-QoS platform support 
NCS platforms support 2-level and 3-level H-QoS. 3-level H-QoS applies a policer (ingress) or shaper (egress) to a physical interface, with each sub-interface having a 2-level H-QoS policy applied. Hierarchical QoS is not enabled by default on the NCS 540 and 5500 platforms. H-QoS is enabled using the <b>hw-module profile qos hqos-enable</b> command.  Once H-QoS is enabled, the number of priority levels which can be assigned is reduced from 1-7 to 1-4. Additionally, any hierarchical QoS policy assigned to a L3 sub-interface using priority levels must include a "shape" command.  

Hierarchical QoS will be available on the Cisco 8010 and 8700 series routers in a future Agile Metro release.  

## Agile Services Core QoS mapping with five classes 
QoS designs are typically tailored for each provider. Ideally a network will utilize as few core QoS classes as necessary. Many modern networks carrying high bandwidth residential traffic could utilize just two classes, Best Effort and Higher Priority. Below is an example of a 5-level QoS design which can fit most provider needs. The design covers transport of both unicast and multicast traffic. If a provider does not need 5 classes, this can always be reduced.   

| Traffic Type |  Core Marking | Core Priority | Comments | 
| ----------|---------|----------|---------------|-------------| 
| Network Control |  EXP 6 | Highest | Underlay network control plane |  
| Low latency | EXP 5 | Highest | Low latency service, consistent delay |  
| High Priority 1 | EXP 3 | Medium-High | High priority service traffic |     
| Medium Priority / Multicast | EXP 2  | Medium priority and multicast | 
| Best Effort | EXP 0 | General user traffic | 

## Multicast 
Multicast traffic distribution can still be an important component in service 
provider networks. Multicast is often used for video distribution and certain 
services requiring distribution communication between endpoints.  

### SRv6 Multicast Deployment  
SRv6 unicast services seamlessly co-exist with traditional deployed multicast
technology such as native PIM-SM/PIM-SSM, IP based mVPN, SR-MPLS Tree-SID, and
mLDP. Multicast traffic today is not encapsulated and delivered via SRv6, but in
future Agile Metro releases we will incorporate new Cisco-led technologies to
bring together a unified control and data-plane using SRv6.  

### L3 Multicast using SR-MPLS Tree-SID
#### Tree SID Diagram 

![](http://xrdocs.io/design/images/asn-metro/cst-treesid.png)

### Tree-SID Overview 
Tree-SID utilizes the programmability of SR-PCE to create and
maintain an optimized multicast tree from source to receiver across an SR-only
IPv4 network.  Each node in the network maintains a session to the same set of SR-PCE
controllers. The SR-PCE creates the tree using PCE-initiated segments. TreeSID
supports advanced functionality such as TI-LFA for fast protection and disjoint
trees.  

#### Static Tree-SID 

Multicast traffic is forwarded across the tree using static S,G mappings at the
head-end source nodes and tail-end receiver nodes. Providers needing a solution
where dynamic joins and leaves are not common, such as broadcast video
deployments, can be benefit from the simplicity static Tree-SID brings,
eliminating the need for distributed BGP mVPN signaling. Static Tree-SID is
supported for both default VRF (Global Routing Table) and mVPN.  

Please see the CST 3.5+ Implementation Guide for static Tree-SID configuration
guidelines and examples. 

#### Dynamic Tree-SID using BGP mVPN Control-Plane 

IOS-XR supports using fully dynamic signaling to create multicast
distribution trees using Tree-SID. Sources and receivers are discovered using
BGP auto-discovery (BGP-AD) and advertised throughout the mVPN using the IPv4 or
IPv6 mVPN AFI/SAFI. Once the source head-end node learns of receivers, the
head-end will create a PCEP request to the configured primary PCE. The PCE then
computes the optimal multicast distribution tree based on the metric-type and
constraints specified in the request. Once the Tree-SID policy is up, multicast
traffic will be forwarded using the tree by the head-end node. Tree-SID
optionally supports TI-LFA for all segments, and the ability to create disjoint
trees for high available applications.   

All routers across the network needing to participate in the tree, including
core nodes, must be configured as a PCC to the primary PCE being used by the
head-end node.  

Please see the Agile Services Networking Implementation Guide for more information 
on implementing SR-MPLS Tree-SID. 

### L3 IP Multicast and mVPN using mLDP  
The Agile Metro design supports using mLDP for multicast distribution when using 
SR-MPLS or SRv6 for unicast transport.  
Using BGP signaling adds additional scale to the network over in-band
mLDP signaling and fits with the overall design goals of CST. More information
about deployment of profile 14 can be found in the Agile Metro implementation
guide. The Agile Services Networking design supports mLDP-based label switched multicast
within a single doman and across IGP domain boundaries. In the case of the Agile
Metro design multicast has been tested with the source and receivers on both
access and ABR PE devices.   

| Supported Multicast Profiles | Description |  
| ----------------------- | ---------------- | 
| Profile 6 | mLDP VRF using in-band signaling | 
| Profile 7 | mLDP global routing table using in-band signaling | 
| Profile 14 | Partitioned MDT using BGP-AD and BGP c-multicast signaling |  

Profile 14 is recommended for all service use cases and supports both
intra-domain and inter-domain transport use cases.  


# Agile Metro subscriber edge components 

## Cloud Native Broadband Network Gateway

Cloud Native Broadband Gateway (cnBNG) represents a fundamental shift in how
providers build converged access networks by separating the subscriber BNG
control-plane functions from user-plane functions. CUPS (Control/User-Plane
Separation) allows the use of scale-out x86 compute for subscriber control-plane
functions, allowing providers to place these network functions at an optimal
place in the network, and also allows simplification of user-plane elements.
This simplification enables providers to distribute user-plane elements closer
to end users, optimizing traffic efficiency to and from subscribers.

## Cisco cnBNG Architecture

Cisco's cnBNG supports the BBF TR-459 standards for control and user plane
communication. The State Control Interface (SCi) is used for programming and
management of dynamic subscriber interfaces including accounting information.
The Control Packet Redirect Interface (CPRi) as its name implies redirects user
packets destined for control-plane functions from the user plane to control
plane. These include: DHCP DORA, DHCPv6, PPPoE, and L2TP. More information on 
TR-459 can be found at <https://www.broadband-forum.org/marketing/download/TR-459.pdf> 

### cnBNG Control Plane 
The cloud native BNG control plane is a highly resilient scale out architecture.
Traditional physical BNGs embedded in router software often scale poorly,
require complex HA mechnaisms for resiliency, and are relatively painful to
upgrade. Moving these network functions to a modern Kubernetes based
cloud-native infrastructure reduces operator complexity providing native
scale-out capacity growth, in-service software upgrades, and faster feature
delivery.  

### cnBNG User Plane 
The cnBNG user plane in Agile Metro 1.1 is provided by Cisco ASR 9000 routers. The routers are
responsible for terminating subscriber sessions (IPoE/PPPoE), communicating with
the cnBNG control plane for user authentication and policy, applying
subscriber policy elements such as QoS and security policies, and performs 
subscriber routing. Fixed and modular platforms are supported  

## Cisco Routed Passive Optical Networking 
Cisco's Routed Optical Networking has helped reduce cost, space, and power by
replacing external transponder hardware with a pluggable transceiver. Cisco
Routed Passive Optical Networking extends this concept by replacing a dedicated
separate XGS-PON OLT chassis with a pluggable OLT used in Cisco routers. This
enables providers to reduce the power and space footprint in remote locations
and converge XGS-PON OLT function on routers providing other services such as 
fiber based L2VPN/L3VPN business services or mobile backhaul. 

### Cisco Routed PON Components 

#### Cisco Routed PON pluggable OLT 

The key component to device level convergence with Cisco RPON is using a pluggable
XGS-PON Optical Line Terminal. This allows the OLT to be used in a standard 
IOS-XR router, eliminating the need for the additional OLT.   

![](http://xrdocs.io/design/images/asn-metro/asn-rpon-pluggable.png){:height="75%" width="75%"}

#### Cisco Routed PON controller  

The Cisco Routed PON controller runs directly on the IOS-XR router hosting the pluggable 
OLT. The software is distributed as part of the IOS-XR software distribution and runs 
as a third party container within IOS-XR's application hosting infrastructure. It provides 
the interface between the Routed PON manager and the pluggable OLT.  

#### Cisco Routed PON manager 

The Cisco Routed PON manager provides all of the functionality to manage pluggable 
OLTs deployed in the field. Provisioning of services is performed either via UI or 
API via the PON Manager. It also serves as a single point of monitoring for the 
OLT/ONU infrastructure. The PON Manager has a standard interface via NETCONF 
used for managing all aspects of the PON network.  

![](http://xrdocs.io/design/images/asn-metro/asn-rpon-manager.png)


# Agile Metro use cases

Service Provider networks must adopt a flexible design satisfying  
any to any connectivity, without compromising in stability
and availability. Moreover, transport programmability is essential to
bring SLA awareness into the network. 

The goal of the Agile Metro is to provide a flexible network
blueprint that can be easily customized to meet customer specific
requirements. This blueprint must adapt to carry any service type, for example  
cable access, mobile, and business services over the same converged network infrastructure. 
The following sections highlight the use cases and the components of the 
design used in building those solutions.  

## Collapsed use cases 
While we describe different use cases it doesn't mean multiple use cases cannot 
be converged on a single device. There are a number of benefits to functional separation in 
networks but there are times due to location size it isn't cost or operational effective
to place dedicated routers for each role at a location. Modern Cisco routers are built to 
handle a wide variety of features covering many use cases.  

## Core
Core routers typically serve a single purpose in providing high density and high 
bandwidth aggregation and connectivity between other core routers. The 8000 series
is ideal for these applications.  

## Peering and content delivery 
Internet peering refers to connecting to the global Internet as well as other
organizations to exchange routing information and ultimately optimize traffic
delivery between networks. The full global routing table now exceeds 1M IPv4 
prefixes and 256K IPv6 prefixes, requiring devices with scale to support both 
internal routing tables as well as the default-free global table.   

## Business edge including mobile backhaul  

### Summary and service types  
The Agile Metro design introduces support for 5G networks and 5G services. There
are a variety of new service use cases being defined by 3GPP for use on 5G
networks, illustrated by the figure below. Networks must now be built to support
the stringent SLA requirements of Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency services while also
being able to cope with the massive bandwidth introduced by Enhanced Mobile
Broadband services. The initial support for 5G in the Converged SDN Transport
design focuses on the backhaul and midhaul portions of the network utilizing end
to end Segment Routing. The design introduces no new service types, the existing
scalable L3VPN and EVPN based services using BGP are sufficient for carrying 5G
control-plane and user-plane traffic.   

### End to End Timing Validation 
End to end timing using PTP with profiles G.8275.1 and G.8275.2 have been
validated in the Agile Metro design. All Cisco hardware validated in the design
supports at least Class B network timing with new A100, K100, and P100 8000
series routers supporting Class C. Best practice configurations are available in
the online configurations and Agile Services Networking Implementation Guide. It
is recommended to use G.8257.1 when possible to main the highest level of
accuracy across the network. 

IOS-XR fully supports G.8275.1 to G.8275.2
interworking, allowing the use of different profiles across the network.
Synchronous Ethernet (SyncE) is also recommended across the network to maintain
stability when timing to the PRC. 

# Network assurance 

## SR Performance Measurement  
The network itself can perform dynamic performance measurement between any two
endpoints in the network. Performance measurement includes delay and loss
calculations. It is recommended SR-PM be enabled on all logical links across
the network.  

### Dynamic Link Performance Measurement
SR-PM supports dynamic measurement of one-way and two-way
delay and loss on logical links. The delay
measurement feature utilizes TWAMP-Lite as the transport mechanism for probes
and responses. PTP is a requirement for accurate measurement of one-way latency
across links and is recommended for all nodes.  In the absence of PTP a
"two-way" delay mode is supported to calculate the one-way link delay.

Legacy hardware also now supports a software CPU based timestamp method to enable
SR-PM delay measurements for hardware without PTP timing hardware.  

Delay and loss measurement is also available for SR-TE Policy paths to give the
provider an accurate latency and loss measurement for all services utilizing the SR-TE
Policy. This information is available through SR Policy statistics using the CLI
or model-driven telemetry. The latency measurement is done for all active
candidate paths.  

### Delay and Loss anomaly detection  
It is possible to set thresholds for both delay and loss and trigger behaviors
based on the type of resource being monitored using SR-PM. In the case of a
SR-Policy, a candidate path can be deactivated if the delay or loss exceeds the
configured thresholds. In the case of a logical link, the IGP advertising the
link will set the "A" or anomaly bit for the link. When a receiving node
receives the IGP link state data with the A bit set, it can raise the IGP cost
on the link. 

The "anomaly-check" command is used for delay thresholds, and the "anomaly-loss"
command is used for loss thresholds.

# Security 

## Security overview
Security is a top priority in building modern networks. Cisco and the Agile
Metro design use a defense in depth strategy. Each layer of security is
addressed starting at the initial manufactured hardware and continuing across
all layers up to the service layer. Application layer security is not covered by
the Agile Metro infrastructure and services design but is covered by additional
Cisco Security products.  

## Cisco DDoS Edge Protection
Cisco's Edge DDoS Protect presents an innovative solution providing fully distributed 
DDoS protection for all places in the network.

The key component of DDoS Edge Protect is a small, lightweight, and containerized DDoS detection engine,
running inside Cisco IOS XR operating system on selected Cisco routers. As a
feature of the router itself, the solution provides out-of-path, full detection,
and granular mitigation capabilities against volumetric DDoS attacks. This
allows the router to become the first line of defense against DDoS attacks where
attack traffic can be blocked in-place and no longer needs to be backhauled to
dedicated scrubbing infrastructure. This gives operators the opportunity to extend
DDoS protection to the edge of the network which would otherwise be
cost-prohibitive and negatively impacting the application latency and the
quality of experience. The overall scrubbing capacity of the network is also increased 
since every router now has DDoS scrubbing capability. 

You can apply this solution to the existing install base and to new router
deployments without requiring any additional hardware.

### DDoS Edge Protect operation 
![](http://xrdocs.io/design/images/asn-metro/metro-ddos-operation.png)

The above diagram explains the operation of Cisco DDoS Edge Protect. Standard 
Netflow data is encapsulated in gRPC messages to the internal Edge Protect agent. 
The data is analzyed by the agent and controller to determine the attack and the 
proper mitigation technique. In most cases a granular ACL can be deployed to the 
router to mitigate a volumetric attack, dropping traffic based on   

#### Exampls ACL Deployment

</pre>


### DDoS Edge Protection management  
The management of the on-router DDoS Edge Protect containers is done through 
Cisco's Edge Protect DDoS controller. The controller manages the deployment of 
containers to the routers and acts as a single pane of glass for monitoring the 
current state of the overall solution. The software tracks ongoing attacks and 
mitigations deployed. 

## MACSec support 
Cisco A100, P100, and K100 8000 routers such as the 8212-32FH-M, 8712-MOD-M, and 
8011-4G24Y4H support MACSec across all ports. This allows providers to build 
end to end networks from access to core protected from man in the middle link 
snooping.  

## IPSec support  
Cisco A100 and K100 8000 routers such as the 8712-MOD-M and 8011-4G24Y4H contain
built-in ASIC support for IPSec. IPSec features and functionality will be
enabled in future releases of IOS-XR and Agile Metro.   

# Agile network automation 
Network automation in Agile Services Networking Network automation plays a key
role in how Agile networks are built and managed.  Cisco’s Crosswork family of
network automation gives network operators the ability to easily deploy network
infrastructure, manage multi-layer network services, and provide advanced levels
of network assurance.  This blog will introduce just a few aspects of Cisco’s
service provider network automation capabilities, please see
<https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/cloud-systems-management/crosswork-network-controller/index.html>
 for an in-depth view of all of the capabilities.  

## IP network management using Cisco Crosswork Network Controller 

Crosswork Network Controller provides a platform for UI and API based network management. Agile Metro 1.1 
utilizes CNC 7.1. CNC 7.1 supports the following major use cases:  

- Device Element Management with fault, alarm, software management, and day-1 configuration deployment using parameterized templates 
- Device performance measurement (DPM) to monitor critical network resources such as traffic utilization, PTP status, and coherent optics performance using advanced telemetry methods and user-defined alert thresholds  
- Advanced network slicing functionality combining policy driven services, underlay traffic engineering, and QoS   
- Workflow manager allows users to create repeatable network automation tasks  
- Bandwidth optimization using tactical traffic engineering  
- Rich visualization of all aspects of network topology including L2VPN and L3VPN services and SRv6, SR-MPLS, and RSVP-TE transport  
- Provisioning of overlay network services and TE paths 

More information on Crosswork Network Controller can be found at: 
<https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/cloud-systems-management/crosswork-network-controller/index.html>

### Fleet upgrade functionality 
CNC 7.1's EMS capability includes the ability to easily manage device software across a variety of 
network roles. Devices can easily be selected by their properties and upgrades scheduled.  

![](http://xrdocs.io/design/images/asn-metro/cnc-71-fleet-upgrade-1.png)

### Network slicing 

### L2VPN Service Provisioning and Visualization
Crosswork Network Controller supports UI and API based provisioning of EVPN-VPWS 
services using the IETF L2NM standard model. Once services are provisionined they 
are visualized using the CNC topology UI along with their underlying SR-TE policies, 
if applicable.  

![](http://xrdocs.io/design/images/asn-metro/cst-5-cnc-l2vpn.png)

### L3VPN Service Provisioning and Visualization
Crosswork Network Controller supports UI and API based provisioning of L3VPN  
services using the IETF L3NM standard model. Once services are provisionined they 
are visualized using the CNC service topology UI along with their underlying SR-TE policies, 
if applicable.  

![](http://xrdocs.io/design/images/asn-metro/cst-5-cnc-l3vpn.png)

### Crosswork Automated Assurance 

In addition to provisioning, monitoring of all 
transport infrastructure is also supported including advanced service assurance for 
xVPN services. Service assurance checks all aspects of the network making up the service 
along with realtime Y.1731 measurements to ensure the defined SLA for the service is met.  

![](http://xrdocs.io/design/images/asn-metro/cst-5-cnc-service-assurance-sla.png)

![](http://xrdocs.io/design/images/asn-metro/cst-5-cnc-assurance.png)

The figure below shows an example of a degraded service where the measured
one-way latency on the end to end path of 1680uS has exceeded the SLA of 500uS. 

![](http://xrdocs.io/design/images/asn-metro/cst-5-cnc-l2vpn-degraded.png)

### Device Performance Measurement  

Device performance measurement policies are used to collect network data from 
specified devices. Traffic data is collected from all supported devices by default. 
Advanced performance policies can be enabled for specific technologies on a subset of 
devices.  

![](http://xrdocs.io/design/images/asn-metro/asn-dpm-create-policy.png)

Once a policy is enabled on a device, it can then be monitored by looking at 
the inventory of the device.   

![](http://xrdocs.io/design/images/asn-metro/asn-dpm-gnss-satellite.png)


## Zero Touch Provisioning

In addition to model-driven configuration and operation, Agile Metro 1.5 
supports ZTP operation for automated device provisioning. ZTP is useful both in 
production as well as staging environments to automate initial device software 
installation, deploy an initial bootstrap configuration, as well as advanced functionality 
triggered by ZTP scripts. ZTP is supported on both out of band management interfaces as 
well as in-band data interfaces. When a device first boots, the IOS-XR ZTP process
beging on the management interface of the device and if no response is received, or the 
the interface is not active, the ZTP process will begin the process on data ports. IOS-XR
can be part of an ecosystem of automated device and service provisioning via Cisco NSO.

### Zero Touch Provisioning using Crosswork Network Controller 

Crosswork Network Controller now includes a ZTP application used to onboard network 
devices with the proper IOS-XR software and base configuration. Crosswork ZTP 
supports both traditional unsecure as well as fully secure ZTP operation as outlined 
in RFC 8572. More information on Crosswork ZTP can be found at 
<https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/collateral/cloud-systems-management/crosswork-network-automation/datasheet-c78-743677.html> 

## Underlay transport management using Crosswork Network Controller
Crosswork Network Controller provides support for provisioning SR-MPLS, SRv6, and RSVP-TE    
traffic engineering paths. The creation of the paths is done through standardized models 
where possible such as the IETF-TE RSVP-TE model. CNC supports full visualization of these 
paths across distributed multi-IGP instance networks. The following figure highlights the ability 
to visualize an end to end SRv6-TE path across multiple IS-IS instances.  

![](http://xrdocs.io/design/images/asn-metro/cnc71-srv6-te-path.png)

CNC can also visualize the end to end IGP path taken by each segment, showing 
ECMP traffic paths.

CNC also supports visualization of Segment Routing Flexible Algorithms deployed 
across the provider network. The following shows nodes participating in the 128 (pink) and 129 (green) algorithms along 
with links interconnecting nodes using the same algorithm. It also displays nodes participaing in both algorithms 
highlighted by the brown color.

## Multi-Layer network management using Crosswork Hierarchical Controller 


# Base protocols supporting advanced use cases  

## Overview

The Agile Metro Design aims to enable simplification across all
layers of a Service Provider network. Thus, the  Agile Metro
services layer focuses on a converged Control Plane based on BGP.

BGP based Services include EVPNs and Traditional L3VPNs (VPNv4/VPNv6).

EVPN is a technology initially designed for Ethernet multipoint services
to provide advanced multi-homing capabilities. By using BGP for
distributing MAC address reachability information over the MPLS network,
EVPN brought the same operational and scale characteristics of IP based
VPNs to L2VPNs. Today, beyond DCI and E-LAN applications, the EVPN
solution family provides a common foundation for all Ethernet service
types; including E-LINE, E-TREE, as well as data center routing and
bridging scenarios. EVPN also provides options to combine L2 and L3
services into the same instance.

To simplify service deployment, provisioning of all services is fully
automated using Cisco Network Services Orchestrator (NSO) using (YANG)
models and NETCONF. Refer to Section: "Network Services Orchestrator (NSO)".

There are two types of services: End-To-End and Hierarchical. The next
two sections describe these two types of services in more detail.

## Ethernet VPN (EVPN)

EVPNs solve two long standing limitations for Ethernet Services in
Service Provider Networks:

  - Multi-Homed & All-Active Ethernet Access

  - Service Provider Network - Integration with Central Office or with
    Data Center
    
### Ethernet VPN Hardware Support 

In Agile Metro EVPN VPWS services are supported on all IOS-XR
devices. EVPN ELAN and ETREE services are supported on specific devices, 
please see specific router software roadmaps for support on all EVPN related 
features.   

## End-To-End (Flat) Services

The End-To-End Services use cases are summarized in the table in Figure
24 and shown in the network diagram in Figure 25.

_Figure 25: End-To-End – Services_

All services use cases are based on BGP Control Plane.

Refer also to Section: "Transport and Services Integration".

## Hierarchical Services

Hierarchical Services Use Cases are summarized in the table of Figure 26
and shown in the network diagram of Figure 27.

![](http://xrdocs.io/design/images/asn-metro/cst-services-hierarchical-5.png)

_Figure 26: Supported Hierarchical Services_

_Figure 27: Hierarchical Services Control Plane_

Hierarchical services designs are critical for Service Providers looking
for limiting requirements on the access platforms and deploying more
centralized provisioning models that leverage very rich features sets on
a limited number of touch points.

Hierarchical Services can also be required by Service Providers who want
to integrate their SP-WAN with the Central Office/Data Center network
using well-established designs based on Data Central Interconnect (DCI).

Figure 27 shows hierarchical services deployed on PE routers, but the
same design applies when services are deployed on AG or DCI routers.

The Agile Metro Design offers scalable hierarchical services with
simplified provisioning. The three most important use cases are
described in the following sections:

  - Hierarchical L2 Multipoint Multi-Homed/All-Active

  - Hierarchical L2/L3 Multi/Single-Home, All/Single-Active Service
    (H-EVPN) and Anycast-IRB

  - Hierarchical L2/L3 Multipoint Multi-Homed/Single-Active (H-EVPN) and
    PWHE
    
### Hierarchical L2 Multipoint Multi-Homed/All-Active

Figure 28 shows a very elegant way to take advantage of the benefits of
Segment-Routing Anycast-SID and EVPN. This use case provides
Hierarchical L2 Multipoint Multi-Homed/All-Active (Single-Homed Ethernet
access) service with traditional access router
integration.

![](http://xrdocs.io/design/images/asn-metro/image29.png)

_Figure 28: Hierarchical Services (Anycast-PW)_

Access Router A1 establishes a Single-Active static pseudowire
(Anycast-Static-PW) to the Anycast IP address of PE1/PE2. PEs anycast IP
address is represented by Anycast-SID.

Access Router A1 doesn’t need to establish active/backup PWs as in a
traditional H-VPLS design and doesn’t need any enhancement on top of the
established spoke pseudowire design.

PE1 and PE2 use BGP EVPN Control Plane to provide Multi-Homed/All-Active
access, protecting from L2 loop, and providing efficient per-flow
load-balancing (with aliasing) toward the remote PEs (PE3/PE4).

A3, PE3 and PE4 do the same, respectively.

### Hierarchical L2/L3 Multi/Single-Home, All/Single-Active Service (H-EVPN) and Anycast-IRB

Figure 29 shows how EVPNs can completely replace the traditional H-VPLS
solution. This use case provides the greatest flexibility as
Hierarchical L2 Multi/Single-Home, All/Single-Active modes are available
at each layer of the service
hierarchy.

![](http://xrdocs.io/design/images/asn-metro/image30.png)

_Figure 29: Hierarchical Services (H-EVPN)_

Optionally, Anycast-IRB can be used to enable Hierarchical L2/L3
Multi/Single-Home, All/Single-Active service and to provide optimal L3
routing.

### Hierarchical L2/L3 Multipoint Multi-Homed/Single-Active (H-EVPN) and PWHE

Figure 30 shows how the previous H-EVPN can be extended by taking
advantage of Pseudowire Headend (PWHE). PWHE with the combination of
Multi-Homed, Single-Active EVPN provides an Hierarchical L2/L3
Multi-Homed/Single-Active (H-EVPN) solution that supports QoS.

It completely replaces traditional H-VPLS based solutions. This use case
provides Hierarchical L2 Multi/Single-Home, All/Single-Active
service.

Refer also to the section: “Transport and Services Integration”.

### EVPN Centralized Gateway
Similar to the Hierarchical L2/L3 service with Anycast-IRB, EVPN Centralized 
Gateway extends that service type by allowing the use of EVPN-ELAN services between 
the access site and core location. In previous versions the Anycast-IRB L3 gateway needed 
to be part of the access L2 domain and could not be placed elsewhere in the EVPN across
the core network.  EVPN CGW relaxes the constraint and allows the L3 Anycast IRB gateway 
to be located at any point in the EVPN ELAN. The IRB can be placed in either the global 
routing table or within a VRF. 

In Agile Metro EVPN Centralized GW is supported on the ASR 9000 platform.  

The figure below shows an example EVPN CGW deployment. In this scenario A-PE3,
A-PE4, A-PE5, PE1, and PE2 all belong to the same EVPN-ELAN EVI 100. The CE
nodes connected to A-PE3, A-PE4, and A-PE5 can communicate at Layer 2 or Layer 3
with eachother without having to traverse the core nodes.  This is one
fundamental difference between EVPN-CGW and EVPN-HE. Traffic destined to another
subnet, such as the 10.0.0.2 address is routed through the CGW core gateway. 

Also in this example CE4 is an example of a multi-homed CE node, utilizing a LAG
across A-PE4/A-PE3. This multi-homed connection can be configured in an
all-active, single-active, or port-active configuration.

_Figure 31: Hierarchical Services EVPN Centralized GW_ 

### EVPN Head-End for L3 Services 
Agile Metro also supports Cisco's EVPN Head-End solution for hierarchical
services. EVPN Head-End is similar to the existing Hierarchical PWHE services,
but allows the use of native EVPN-VPWS between the access PE node and
centralized PE node. This simplifies deployments by allowing providers to use
the fully dynamic EVPN control plane for signaling, including the ability to
signal active/backup signaling between access PE and core PE nodes. In CST 5.0
EVPN-HE is supported for L3 service termination, with the L3 gateway residing on
either a PWHE P2P interface or BVI interface. The L3 GW can reside in the global 
routing table or within a VRF.    

In Agile Metro EVPN-HE for L3 services is supported on the ASR 9000 platform and 
select P100 line cards such as the 88-LC1-12TH24FH-E and 88-LC1-52Y8H-EM.   

The figure below shows a typical EVPN Head-End deployment. A-PE3 is configured
as an EVPN-VPWS endpoint, with PE1 and PE2 configured with the same EVPN-VPWS
EVI, acting as All-Active or Single-Active gateways. PE1 and PE2 are configured
with the same 10.1.0.1/24 address on the terminating L3 interface, providing a
redundant gateway for the CE device with address 10.1.0.2/24. While not shown in
this figure, the CE device could also be multi-homed to two separate A-PE nodes in 
a all-active, single-active, or port-active configuration.
